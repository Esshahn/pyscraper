# pyscraper
Python script scraping product websites that will send you an email if a defined price is reached.
Currently supporting Amazon and the Nintendo Store.

based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY
and adapted by Ingo Hinterding

The script takes a JSON file containing URLs of products and a desired price to check for. If the current price is equal or lower than the desired price, it sends an email to the specified account.

Note that the price scraped from the website is converted based on german currency notation, e.g. "1.234,56 â‚¬". 
You might want to adapt it to your currency notation.

## install
`pip3 install requests bs4`

## run directly
`python3 pyscraper.py`

## configure your email account
watch the youtube video for a good start how to configure gmail

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY

# configure email.json

`"email_from": "your_sender_email@example.com"`

Fill in an email address from where the emails will be send

`"email_from_password": "your_sender_password"`

Fill in the password for the sender email address

`"email_from_smtp": "smtp.gmail.com"`

The SMTP server of your email provider, e.g. Google Mail

`"email_from_port": 587`

The port number of your email provider

`"email_to_default": "your_default_email@example.com"`

Where emails get send to by default (execptions can be made per product). This can be the same email address you specify above, if you're using the script just for yourself.

# configure products.json
Edit the file `amazon.json` to add or remove product URLs and prices

```
"products": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.amazon.de/Hellblade-Senuas-Sacrifice-PlayStation-4/dp/B07JH57258/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=hellblade&qid=1575971001&s=videogames&sr=1-2",
      "price": 29,
      "email": "email_goes_to@example.com"
    }
```

`url` 

Insert the URL to the product you want to track (it doesn't matter if the query changes or has extra data as long as the website ist displayed correctly)

`price`

The desired price of the product. Integer number. The script will send an email if the price is equal or lower.

`email` (optional, remove if not needed)

You can add this line if you want to send the alarm to a different email address. Great if you want to share this script with friends.




# setup a cronjob (e.g. on Raspberry Pi)
good tutorial here: https://medium.com/@gavinwiener/how-to-schedule-a-python-script-cron-job-dea6cbf69f4e

`crontab -e`

Add a line, e.g. mine is (every day at 14:55)

`55 14 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/code/scraper/scraper.py >> /home/pi/code/scraper/log.txt`



# Version History

## 1.3

- The Amazon and Nintendo scrapers have been merged
- Automatic detection of the website domain

## 1.22

- I added a random number to the Safari GET header, which seems to prevent Amazon asking if the script is a robot.

## 1.21

- Nintendo: there's no need for an additional ajax url anymore, the script detects the right one automatically

## 1.20

- removed the email configuration out of the `products.json` into its own `email.json`
- added `_amazon` suffix to the scraper.py and the products.json filenames
- added a scraper for the Nintendo website. This one is a bit more complicated as it requires a bit of knowledge how to detect Ajax scripts with the developer tools of your browser. The price is loaded via ajax and needs to be parsed separately. To get the correct url, load in the webpage with the dev tools and watch the network/XHR tab. There should be calls with a url you can use (will make this automatic in the next version)

## 1.10

- a complete rewrite with everything shuffled around
- in an attempt to clean the code I probably made it worse... :)
- nah, guess we're fine...
- migrated SMTP and PORT information from code to JSON file where it belongs
- abstracted the functions better

## 1.02

- Some (very basic) error handling is added for when no price was found (you'll be informed by email, too)
- removed terminal clear command and added timestamp output so that it can write to a log file (log.txt)

## 1.01

- a different price formatting approach should work better with multiple currencies
- checking for more CSS tags on Amazon's product website
- sender and recipient emails can now be different
- you can specify a different email for each product search

## 1.0

- initial release
